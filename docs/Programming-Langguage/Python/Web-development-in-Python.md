# Web development in Python

**Python** is quite capable when it comes to web development, and there are a variety of frameworks and modules are available for it. These can be used to create web applications.

**Flask**, **Django**, and **Pyramid** are a few well-known frameworks. The choice of framework will rely on the project's requirements. Each of these frameworks has advantages and disadvantages of its own.

## Creating a basic web app using Flask

Creating a basic web application using **Flask**: **Flask** is a micro web framework for **Python** that is easy to learn and use. It provides a simple way to create web applications and **APIs** using **Python**. Here are some examples of Flask code for creating a basic web application:

``` python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!' 
```
This code creates a **Flask application** and defines a single route for the root **URL** (/). When the user visits the **URL**, the *hello_world()* function is called and returns the string 'H**ello, World!**'.

## Working with databases:

The majority of online applications need some sort of permanent storage, and **Python** offers a number of modules and frameworks for doing so. Popular options include **Django ORM**, **Peewee**, and **SQLAlchemy**. Here is an illustration of how to work with a **SQLite** database using **SQLAlchemy**:

``` python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///test.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(50))

@app.route('/')
def index():
    users = User.query.all()
    return render_template('index.html', users=users)
```
This code creates a **SQLite** database and a User table using **SQLAlchemy**. The *index()* function queries the database for all users and passes them to the template for rendering.

Having a good understanding of how these web apps work, will help you with automation and deployment when it comes to practicing **DevOps**.

## Serverless Technologies

You can dive deeper into how you can build **APIs** using **Python** and serverless technologies like:

- Google Cloud Functions
- IBM Cloud Functions
- Alibaba Cloud Function Compute
- Aliyun Serverless Compute Service
- Tencent Cloud Functions
- Digital Ocean Functions
- Linode Functions
- UpCloud Functions
- Vultr Functions

I have a demo on [how I built a serverless resume API](https://github.com/rishabkumar7/AzureResumeAPI).
