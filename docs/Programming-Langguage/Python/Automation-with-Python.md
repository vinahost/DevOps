# Automation with Python

Using **Python** for infrastructure management involves automating the management of **IT Infrastructure**, such as *servers*, *databases*, and *networking* equipment. This can include tasks like provisioning, configuration, and orchestration.

**Python** is a popular language for infrastructure management, and there are several tools and libraries available to help with this. Some popular tools for infrastructure management that use **Python** include:

- **Fabric** is a command-line tool that allows you to run commands on remote machines. It is a powerful tool that can be used to automate a wide range of tasks.

- **PyWinRM**  is a **Python** library that allows you to interact with Windows machines using the **Remote Management (RMM)** protocol. It is a good choice for automating tasks on **Windows** machines.

- **Pulumi** is a *Cloud Infrastructure as Code* (**CIaC**) tool that allows you to create, manage, and update infrastructure using code. It is a good choice for automating tasks in the cloud

## Fabric

**Fabric** is a **Python** library that can be used for streamlining **SSH** commands and remote execution of scripts, which can be used to automate server configuration and deployment.

Here is an example in which we will be using the **Fabric** library to connect to a remote server using **SSH**, and then run the `ls -l` command on the remote server. The output of the command will be printed to the **console**.

``` python
from fabric import Connection

# Connect to the remote server
c = Connection('user@remote.host')

# Run a command on the remote server
result = c.run('ls -l')

# Print the output of the command
print(result.stdout)
```


## PyWinRM

 A **Python** library that can be used to automate **Windows Remote Management** tasks, which can be used to automate **Windows Server** configuration and management.

## Pulumi

**Pulumi** is a *Cloud Infrastructure as Code* (**CIaC**) tool that lets you define and manage cloud resources in a variety of programming languages, including **Python**.

You can use Pulumi to write **Python** code to describe your infrastructure as code, and then use the **Pulumi** **CLI** to deploy and manage it. Here is an example:

``` python
import pulumi
from pulumi_aws import ec2

# Define an EC2 instance
server = ec2.Instance('server',
    instance_type='t2.micro',
    ami='ami-0c55b159cbfafe1',
    tags={
        'Name': 'cloud-server',
    },
)

# Export the server's IP address
pulumi.export('ip_address', server.public_ip)
```

In this example, we're using the **Pulumi Python SDK** to define an **EC2** instance on **AWS**. We specify the instance type, the **AMI ID**, and some tags for the instance, and then export the instance's public IP address. ou can then use the **Pulumi CLI** to deploy this infrastructure, which will create the **EC2** instance on **AWS**. You can also use the **Pulumi CLI** to manage your infrastructure over time, making changes and updates as needed.
